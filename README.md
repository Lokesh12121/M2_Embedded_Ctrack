# Server Room Temperature Monitering System

Several consumer devices now involve temperature monitoring. For example, most of the air conditioners on the market feature climate control, where the AC continuously monitors the ambient temperature of a room and accordingly regulates the air conditioning. Even some digital clocks now have temperature monitors embedded in them. Many other consumer appliances also offer temperature monitoring.
