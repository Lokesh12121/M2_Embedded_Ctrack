# Requirements

## 1. What, Why, When, Who, How
### What
In Monitoring Temperature and humidity for Server Room is a system, which provides information while regulating temperature and humidity inside the server room. There are various types of sensors in the prototype, using all parameters of temperature and humidity that can be measured. This system can be used to monitor the temperature or humidity of a particular room or place.
  
  :+1: **Pros :**  Simple, easy to maintain and manage.

  :-1: **Cons :**  To maintain accurate temperature
   
### Why
The computer rooms contain servers and data of very high value. The normal temperature in a server room should be between 21 and 25°C. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends a temperature between 18°C and 27°C. In fact, going from 20°C to 27°C reduces eclectic consumption by 4%

### When
The apllication can be used to make improved safety in server rooms, better reporting and forecasting data continously.

### Who
It can be used for any server rooms, datacentor platorm either it can be pharma store( since it contains flamables ), retail shop, personal inventory etc. to monitor the temperature

### How
With the use of simple interface with the screen, the person can visualize data.
